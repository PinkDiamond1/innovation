## About the Hub
The Innovation Hub seeks to highlight Legislative branch activities that use technology to cultivate collaboration, foster data standardization, and increase transparency. The Hub includes information to help law-making bodies innovate, communicate, and legislate effectively, and it is being developed iteratively by non-partisan support staff in United States Legislative branch organizations coordinated through the Congressional Data Task Force in collaboration with civil society using GitHub Pages.
