## Congress.gov Virtual Public Forum

### Description
The Library of Congress will hold a free virtual forum on Wednesday, September 21, 2022, from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. EDT to discuss Congress.gov, the authoritative source for federal legislative information, and to receive public feedback about the site. [Registration is open to all](https://loc.zoomgov.com/webinar/register/WN_Pc8xbjd_TWOw7UQZv_rMdg). The Library encourages everyone interested in legislative data, from experienced Congress.gov users to those who may be new to tracking federal legislative activity to attend.  
  
The forum will feature presentations on recent enhancements to the site and a preview of updates in the works. Attendees will also hear from the data partners that make Congress.gov possible: the Library of Congress, the Government Publishing Office, the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives. Partners will provide insight into a range of efforts underway to modernize and improve accessibility to legislative data.  
  
The public forum is intended to solicit input from the public. Attendees will have the opportunity to participate in live Q&A and discussion segments. Congress.gov users who would like to submit feedback in writing may do so before and after the event using the [Congress.gov Public Forum Survey Form](https://www.research.net/r/cdg-forum-feedback).
  
This marks the third Congress.gov virtual public forum since 2020. You can watch recordings from the [2020](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/10/thank-you-for-joining-us-for-the-congress-gov-virtual-public-forum/) and [2021](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2021/09/thank-you-for-attending-the-2021-congress-gov-virtual-public-forum/) forums on the Law Libraryâ€™s blog.
